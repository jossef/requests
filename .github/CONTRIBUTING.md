# How to contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## Code of Conduct 📜

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the 
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold 
this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [youn@melois.dev](mailto:youn@melois.dev).

## Questions 🤔

The GitHub issue tracker is for *bug reports* and *feature requests*. Please do 
not use it to ask questions about how to use Requests. These questions should 
instead be directed to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Make sure 
that your question is tagged with the `dart-requests` tag when asking it on 
Stack Overflow, to ensure that it is answered accurately.

## Good bug reports 🐛

Please be aware of the following things when filing bug reports:

1. Avoid raising duplicate issues. *Please* use the GitHub issue search feature
   to check whether your bug report or feature request has been mentioned in
   the past. Duplicate bug reports and feature requests are a huge maintenance
   burden on the limited resources of the project. If it is clear from your
   report that you would have struggled to find the original, that's ok, but
   if searching for a selection of words in your issue title would have found
   the duplicate then the issue will likely be closed extremely abruptly.
2. Make sure you provide a suitable amount of information to work with. This
   means you should provide:
   
   - Guidance on **how to reproduce the issue**. Ideally, this should be a
     *small* code sample that can be run immediately by the maintainers.
     Failing that, let us know what you're doing, how often it happens, what
     environment you're using, etc. Be thorough: it prevents us needing to ask
     further questions.
   - Tell us **what you expected to happen**. When we run your example code,
     what are we expecting to happen? What does "success" look like for your
     code?
   - Tell us **what actually happens**. It's not helpful for you to say "it
     doesn't work" or "it fails". Tell us *how* it fails: do you get an
     exception? A hang? A non-200 status code? How was the actual result
     different from your expected result?
